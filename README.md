DirectXApps
===========

This is where I keep any sort of DirectX related code, including game engines or graphics engines that use it.

<div>
Current Projects
<ul>
  <li>GfxFramework - This is a DX10 Renderer with a lot of other features include a geometry library, geometry generator, math library ( including quaternions ), as well as MPR Collision Detection.</li>
  <li>DX11Fraework - This is a DX11 renderer and game engine that will eventually turn into my full fledged game engine that has a DX and OGL renderer.</li>
</ul>
